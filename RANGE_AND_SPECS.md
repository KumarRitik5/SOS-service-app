# üì° ResQLink - Communication Range & Technical Specifications

## üéØ **COMMUNICATION RANGE**

### **Direct P2P Range (Device-to-Device)**

#### **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**
- **Optimal Range**: 10-30 meters (33-100 feet)
- **Maximum Range**: Up to 100 meters (328 feet) in perfect conditions
- **Conditions Affecting Range**:
  - ‚úÖ **BEST**: Open outdoor space, line of sight
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **GOOD**: Indoor with minimal obstacles (15-20m)
  - ‚ùå **REDUCED**: Through walls, multiple floors (5-10m)
  - ‚ùå **POOR**: Dense concrete, metal structures (2-5m)

#### **WiFi Direct**
- **Optimal Range**: 30-50 meters (100-165 feet)
- **Maximum Range**: Up to 200 meters (656 feet) in perfect conditions
- **Conditions Affecting Range**:
  - ‚úÖ **BEST**: Open outdoor space, line of sight
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **GOOD**: Indoor environment (30-40m)
  - ‚ùå **REDUCED**: Multiple walls/obstacles (15-25m)

#### **Combined Technology (BLE + WiFi Direct)**
Your app uses **BOTH** simultaneously via Nearby Connections API:
- **Typical Range**: **10-50 meters** depending on environment
- **Adaptive**: Automatically switches to strongest signal
- **Redundancy**: If one fails, the other continues working

## üéì **RANGE OPTIMIZATION TIPS**

### **For Maximum Coverage**

1. **Spread Out Devices**
   - Keep 10-30m spacing between devices
   - Avoid clustering all devices in one spot
   - Position devices at edges of area

2. **Use High Ground**
   - Place devices on upper floors
   - Elevate phones when possible
   - Avoid basements/underground

3. **Minimize Obstacles**
   - Keep phones out of metal containers
   - Avoid thick concrete walls
   - Use windows/openings for better signal

4. **Keep Bluetooth/WiFi On**
   - Airplane mode will disable mesh
   - WiFi doesn't need internet connection
   - Bluetooth must be enabled

5. **Maintain Battery**
   - Keep phones charged (>20%)
   - Use battery saver mode
   - Disable unnecessary apps

### **For Rescuers**

1. **Deploy Relay Devices**
   - Place phones every 20-30m
   - Create chain from disaster site to command center
   - Use volunteers' phones as relays

2. **Monitor Hop Count**
   - Check hop count in message details
   - Low hop count = victim is close
   - High hop count = message traveled far through mesh

3. **Strategic Positioning**
   - Place devices at decision points
   - Cover all possible escape routes
   - Maintain line-of-sight when possible

## üß™ **TESTING RANGE**

### **Simple Test (2 Devices)**

1. **Device A**: Send SOS with custom message
2. **Device B**: Move away slowly
3. **Test Points**:
   - ‚úÖ 5m: Should work perfectly
   - ‚úÖ 10m: Should work reliably
   - ‚úÖ 20m: Should work (outdoor)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è 30m: May work (depends on environment)
   - ‚ùå 50m+: Unlikely without obstacles

### **Mesh Test (3+ Devices)**

1. **Device A**: Send SOS (victim)
2. **Device B**: Place at 20m (relay)
3. **Device C**: Place at 40m (rescuer)
4. **Result**: C receives message via B
5. **Check**: Message shows hop count = 1

### **Range Mapping**

1. Mark starting position (SOS sender)
2. Walk in different directions
3. Note where message stops being received
4. Create "coverage map" of area
5. Add relay devices to extend coverage
