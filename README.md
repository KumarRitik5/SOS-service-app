## 🌟 What is ResQLink?

**ResQLink** is a **zero-infrastructure emergency communication system** that works when everything else fails. During earthquakes, floods, building collapses, or any disaster that destroys cellular networks, ResQLink creates an **instant mesh network** using only the smartphones already in people's pockets.

### 💡 The Problem

When disasters strike:
- ❌ Cell towers collapse or lose power
- ❌ Internet infrastructure fails
- ❌ Traditional emergency calls don't work
- ❌ Victims can't communicate their location
- ❌ Rescuers can't coordinate effectively
- ❌ **Lives are lost due to communication breakdown**

### ✅ Our Solution

ResQLink creates a **peer-to-peer mesh network** that:
- ✅ Works completely **offline** (no internet/cell towers needed)
- ✅ Uses **Bluetooth + WiFi Direct** built into every smartphone
- ✅ Automatically **relays messages** through nearby devices
- ✅ Extends range up to **3-5 kilometers** with enough devices
- ✅ Broadcasts GPS location with one tap
- ✅ **Saves lives** by connecting victims to rescuers

## � How It Works

### The Technology Behind ResQLink

ResQLink uses **three layers of technology** to create a resilient emergency communication network:

#### **Layer 1: Device Discovery (Finding Nearby Phones)**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR PHONE                             │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ Bluetooth LE Broadcasting        │  │
│  │ "I'm here! Name: John"           │  │
│  │ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓                       │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NEARBY PHONES (within 10-200m)         │
│  Phone A: "I found John!"               │
│  Phone B: "I found John!"               │
│  Phone C: "I found John!"               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How Discovery Works:**
1. **App starts** → Begins broadcasting identity via Bluetooth LE
2. **Nearby phones** detect the broadcast signal
3. **Connection request** sent automatically
4. **Handshake** completes in 1-3 seconds
5. **Re-scans every 15 seconds** to find new devices

**Optimization:**
- Uses **P2P_STAR** strategy (2-3x faster than P2P_CLUSTER)
- **Aggressive re-discovery** catches devices that come into range
- **Smart retry** attempts connection 5 times before giving up

---

#### **Layer 2: Mesh Network Formation (Creating the Web)**

```
Before (Isolated):          After (Mesh Network):

Device A                    Device A ←→ Device B
                                 ↕         ↕
Device B                    Device C ←→ Device D
                                 ↕         ↕
Device C                    Device E ←→ Device F

Device D
```

**How Mesh Forms:**
1. **Each device** connects to nearby devices (within range)
2. **Connections form web** - Devices become relay nodes
3. **Network topology** adapts as devices move
4. **Self-healing** - If one device disconnects, network routes around it

**Key Advantage:**
- **No central server** needed
- **Decentralized** - No single point of failure
- **Scalable** - Works with 2 or 2000 devices
- **Resilient** - Survives device failures

#### **Layer 3: Message Relay (Extending the Range)**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Step 1: Victim Sends SOS                           │
│  ┌────────┐                                         │
│  │ YOU    │ "HELP! Trapped under debris"            │
│  │ (SOS)  │ GPS: 12.345, 78.901                     │

│  └────────┘  └────────┘  └────────┘                 │
│  Each re-broadcasts message (Hop 1)                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ Message continues spreading
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Step 3: Further Survivors Relay                    │
│  ┌────────┐  ┌────────┐                             │
│  │Person D│  │Person E│  (150m from victim)         │
│  │(140m)  │  │(180m)  │                             │
│  └────────┘  └────────┘                             │
│  Message continues (Hop 2)                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ Message reaches rescue teams
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Step 4: Rescuers Receive Location                  │
│  ┌──────────┐                                       │
│  │ RESCUER  │ "SOS from YOU (Hop count: 3)"         │
│  │ (300m)   │ "GPS: 12.345, 78.901"                 │
│  └──────────┘ "Estimated 300m away"                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**How Message Relay Works:**
1. **Victim sends SOS** with GPS coordinates
2. **Nearby devices receive** (within 10-200m)
3. **Each device re-broadcasts** message with hop count +1
4. **Duplicate prevention** - Device checks if it has seen message before
5. **Message continues** spreading through network
6. **Rescuers receive** location and can navigate to victim

**Smart Features:**
- **Hop counter** shows message path length
- **UUID tracking** prevents infinite loops
- **Automatic relay** - No user interaction needed
- **Broadcasts for 5 minutes** - 30 transmissions total

### 🔗 For Relay Nodes (Extending Network)

#### **Anyone Can Be a Relay!**

If you're not a victim or rescuer, you can still help:

1. **Keep app open** - That's it!
2. **Your phone becomes a relay** - Automatically forwards messages
3. **Extends network range** - Helps messages reach farther
4. **Passive participation** - No action needed from you
5. **Save battery** - Disable WiFi Priority if not moving

**Example:**
```
Victim → You (relay) → Rescuer
(50m)      (100m)
Total: 150m reach (victim couldn't reach rescuer directly!)
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### ❌ **"Not Connecting to Other Devices"**

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ **Bluetooth enabled** on both devices?
2. ✅ **WiFi enabled** (doesn't need internet, just "on")?
3. ✅ **Location permission** granted?
4. ✅ **NOT in Airplane Mode**?
5. ✅ **Other device has app open** and discovery started?
6. ✅ **Within range**: 30m (Bluetooth) or 200m (WiFi mode)?
7. ✅ **Android 5.0+**: Check device compatibility

**Fix:**
```bash
1. Close app completely
2. Turn Bluetooth OFF, then ON
3. Reopen app
4. Wait 15-30 seconds for auto-discovery
```

---

#### ❌ **"Connection Keeps Dropping"**

**This is normal!** The app:
- ✅ Auto-reconnects every 15 seconds
- ✅ Retries failed connections 5 times
- ✅ Network "heals" automatically

**If persistent:**
- Check battery isn't too low (<10%)
- Ensure devices aren't moving too fast
- Try WiFi Priority Mode for stable connections
- Reduce distance between devices

---

#### ❌ **"GPS Not Working"**

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ **Location permission** = "Allow all the time"?
2. ✅ **Location services** enabled in Android settings?
3. ✅ **Outdoors or near window**? (GPS needs sky view)
4. ✅ **Wait 30-60 seconds** for GPS lock?

**Fix:**
```bash
Settings → Apps → ResQLink → Permissions → Location
→ Select "Allow all the time"
```

**Fallback:**
- App uses last known location if GPS unavailable
- Indoor GPS may be inaccurate (10-50m error)

---

#### ❌ **"Battery Draining Fast"**

**Reduce battery usage:**

1. **Disable WiFi Priority Mode**
   - Settings → WiFi Priority Mode → OFF
   - Saves 3-5% per hour

2. **Enable Battery Saver**
   - Android Settings → Battery → Battery Saver

3. **Reduce Screen Brightness**
   - Dark theme already optimized

4. **Close Other Apps**
   - More free RAM = better performance

**Expected drain:**
- Normal: 2-5% per hour
- WiFi Priority: 5-10% per hour
- These rates are acceptable for emergency use!

---

#### ❌ **"Messages Not Sending"**

**Check:**
1. ✅ At least 1 peer connected?
   - Status should say "Connected to X Peer(s)"
   - If 0, wait for discovery or move closer

2. ✅ GPS location captured?
   - Wait 5 seconds after tapping SOS
   - "Location captured!" should appear

3. ✅ Bluetooth/WiFi still enabled?
   - Check quick settings panel

**Debug:**
```bash
# Connect phone to PC via USB
flutter logs

# Look for:
📡 = Device found
✅ = Connected
❌ = Failed (will retry)
```

---

#### ❌ **"App Crashes on Launch"**

**Try:**
1. **Clear app cache**
   - Settings → Apps → ResQLink → Storage → Clear Cache

2. **Reinstall app**
   - Uninstall completely
   - Reinstall APK
   - Grant all permissions

3. **Check Android version**
   - Need Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher
   - Settings → About Phone → Android Version

4. **Report bug**
   - [Open GitHub issue](https://github.com/KumarRitik5/SOS-service-app/issues)
   - Include device model and Android version

---
